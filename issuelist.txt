Issue 1 - Images come back with a download. This should be occur. The image should be on the canvas so that it can be used and is only temporary. When app is close, image are gone.
Done download option disabled in the app
Issue 2 - Dragging the signature image or signature initial to Word shows a blob rather than an image. An image should show up on Word. I am testing with Word version 16 and Chrome.
Dragging doesn't work however copy paste works I tested with Edge and Chrome the sample doesn't work either probably modern browser doesn't support this anymore I on't have older IE to test.

Issue 3 - Click the Add button after the draw Signature has been added. The screen comes back show 3 new signatures. The correct result should be only another 1 added not 2.
